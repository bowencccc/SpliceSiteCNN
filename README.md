# Splice Site Prediction

This project includes two main Python scripts:
- `model_train.py`: Trains a CNN model for splice site prediction using labeled sequence data.
- `score.py`: Applies the trained model to score splice junctions.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bowencccc/SpliceSiteCNN.git
cd SpliceSiteCNN
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

conda create -n splice_pred python=3.10 -y  
conda activate splice_pred  
pip install -r requirements.txt  


## How to Run

### 1. Train the Model

### Example: Training the Model

Below is an example command to run the `model_train.py` script. It demonstrates how to supply all required input files and specify where to save the trained model:

```bash
python model_train.py \
  --reliable_junctions ./drosophila/GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_genomic.fna.reliable_junctions.bed \
  --out_junctions ./drosophila/out.junctions.bed \
  --reference_genome ./drosophila/GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_genomic.fna \
  --stringtie_gtf ./drosophila/GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_genomic.fna.gtf \
  --output_file trained_model.pth
```

#### What this command does:  
Launches model_train.py, which will read in known “reliable” splice junctions, reference genome sequences, and annotation data to train a CNN-based splice site predictor.  
After training, it saves the model weights to trained_model.pth so you can use them later for scoring new sequences.

#### Breakdown of each argument:  
--reliable_junctions ./drosophila/GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_genomic.fna.reliable_junctions.bed  
Path to a BED file containing high‐confidence (reliable) splice junction coordinates.  
The script will extract positives and easy negatives splice site examples from this file.  


--out_junctions ./drosophila/out.junctions.bed  
Path to the tiecov BED file.  
The script will extract more difficult negatives splice site examples from this file.  

--reference_genome ./drosophila/GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_genomic.fna  
Path to the reference genome FASTA (.fna) used to fetch sequence context around each junction.  
The model requires a fixed-length window of nucleotides flanking each junction, which it reads from this genome file.  

--stringtie_gtf ./drosophila/GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_genomic.fna.gtf  
Path to the GTF file generated by StringTie (or another assembler) containing transcript annotations.  
This file is used to locate exon/intron boundaries and filter more difficult negatives for training.  

--output_file trained_model.pth  
Filename (with .pth extension) where the trained PyTorch model weights will be saved.  
After the script finishes, you can pass this file to score.py (or a similar evaluation script) to score new sequences.  


### 2. Score New Junctions and Transcripts

### Example: Scoring New Junctions

```bash
python score.py \
  --model_path ./trained_model.pth \
  --reference_genome ./drosophila/GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_genomic.fna \
  --stringtie_gtf ./drosophila/GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_genomic.fna.gtf \
  --output_file score.tsv
```

#### What this command does:  
Runs score.py to load the pre-trained model weights from ./trained_model.pth and use the reference genome and annotation data to score splice junctions.  
Writes all predicted junction scores into score.tsv, and the minimum junction score for each transcript into min_score.tsv

#### Breakdown of each argument:  
--model_path ./output_prefix3.pth  
Specifies the path to the trained PyTorch model weights file (must be in .pth format).  

--reference_genome ./drosophila/GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_genomic.fna  
Path to the reference genome FASTA file used to extract sequence context around each splice junction.  

--stringtie_gtf ./drosophila/GCF_000001215.4_Release_6_plus_ISO1_MT_genomic.fna.gtf  
Path to the GTF file you want to score.  

--output_file score.tsv  
Specifies the output TSV file where each splice junction’s predicted score will be saved.
